# RNASeq_Tpseudonana

4/15/18

The purpose of this project is to identify genes that are differentially expressed by the model diatom Thalassiosira
pseudonana under varying light-dependent growth rates (for more info on culture conditions, see Fisher and Halsey 2016).
RNA was extracted from cells grown under continuous culture. Three separate cultures were grown under each of three
conditions, leadings to a total of 9 samples (High light (HLA/B/C), medium light (MLA/B/C), and low light (LLA/B/C)).
